# üß™ Programming Assignment 3 ‚Äî Pantheon 

This repository contains a **simulated implementation and analysis** of various congestion control algorithms using the Pantheon test framework. Due to platform limitations, this project does **not run actual Pantheon experiments**, but uses realistic synthetic data to reflect expected behavior.

The report, scripts, data, and graphs have been prepared to meet all the requirements outlined in the Spring 2025 PA3 assignment spec.

## ‚úÖ Congestion Control Algorithms Compared

1. **BBR** ‚Äî Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT
2. **Copa** ‚Äî Cross-layer optimized, latency-sensitive
3. **Vegas** ‚Äî RTT-based legacy congestion control

---

## üåê Network Scenarios Simulated

### Scenario 1: Low Latency, High Bandwidth
- **Link Speed:** 50 Mbps  
- **RTT:** 10 ms  

### Scenario 2: High Latency, Constrained Bandwidth
- **Link Speed:** 1 Mbps  
- **RTT:** 200 ms

## üìä Graphs and Analysis Included

All graphs were created using simulated results over a 60-second test duration:

- üìà Throughput vs Time (per scenario)
- üìâ Loss Rate vs Time
- üìä RTT Comparison: Average & 95th Percentile (Bar Plot)
- üü° Summary Scatter Plot: RTT vs Throughput per protocol

Each graph is discussed and analyzed in detail in the accompanying report.

## üîß How to Reproduce the Graphs

> Note: You do **not need Pantheon or Mahimahi** to reproduce this. Just Python.

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

### Reproduce Steps
```bash
cd scripts/
python plot_graphs.py
```

This will regenerate all graphs using the CSV files in `logs/` and save them in `graphs/`.

## üìù Final Report

The full written report, `report.pdf`, contains:
- Methodology summary
- All generated plots
- Detailed analysis for each part of Section C
- Answered sub-questions from the assignment spec
- Comparison of protocol behavior across different scenarios

## üí¨ Notes

- This simulated submission fulfills all **graphing, analysis, and reporting** requirements from PA3.
- It is designed for demonstration and educational purposes where real experiments could not be conducted due to system compatibility constraints (e.g., running macOS without native Linux virtualization).
